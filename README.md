Reduce your wingspan, earn money, and be an NBA Superstar

## Hypothetical

You get 2<sup>x</sup> * 10 dollars tax free into your bank account. x = the number of inches you will reduce in your wingspan. What will you choose for x? Positive integers only.

#### Clarifications

* It’s as though your arms are being sucked into your torso, but you get to keep your shoulders for mobility.

* Your arms remain proportional in terms of length, but your hands always stay the same size.

## NBA Players

I started with trying to feature the wingspans of [SLAM’S TOP 100 PLAYERS OF ALL-TIME](https://www.interbasket.net/news/23623/2018/05/slam-top-100-nba-players-all-time-full-list/), but many of the players either had the same wingspan, or their wingspan was never recorded.

Once I had a small list, I rounded it out so that it sits at 21 players separated by 1 inch, ranging from wingspans of 73 inches (Ty Lawson) up to 93 inches (Rudy Gobert). All wingspans are rounded to the nearest whole number.

| Wingspan | NBA Player          |
|----------|---------------------|
| 73       | Ty Lawson           |
| 74       | Isaiah Thomas       |
| 75       | Allen Iverson       |
| 76       | Stephen Curry       |
| 77       | Steve Nash          |
| 78       | Joe Harris          |
| 79       | Jrue Holiday        |
| 80       | Russell Westbrook   |
| 81       | Jerry West          |
| 82       | Charles Barkley     |
| 83       | Michael Jordan      |
| 84       | LeBron James        |
| 85       | Tony Parker         |
| 86       | Tracy McGrady       |
| 87       | Scottie Pippen      |
| 88       | Bill Russell        |
| 89       | Kevin Durant        |
| 90       | Hakeem Olajuwon     |
| 91       | Shaquille O'Neal    |
| 92       | Kareem Abdul-Jabbar |
| 93       | Rudy Gobert         |
